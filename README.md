spectre-tracking
================

This module contains the tracker for Spectre. It is implemented as a simple library that takes the tracking data as parameter and stores it into the database. The tracker requires a valid and established connection to MongoDB (which is the primary data store for Spectre). The spectre-api provides an easy API layer to request data from the database.
